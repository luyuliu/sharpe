To-Do-List
1. (COMPLETE) Clip data to 9 different regions (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/maps/us-climate-regions.php ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47426396/119890629-12242600-bf06-11eb-8d5e-6c391a1a3564.png)
2. (COMPLETE) Modify RF/RK model to run on each of the nine regions
3. Training with all data, testing against the in situ stations
4. Tuning should help avoid overfitting, allow for adjustments to the number of trees, depth of trees, which features are used to split nodes, how many samples are created when a node is split, and bootstrapping methods
5. Test to see if there is a difference based on the regional subsets
6. Compare with RK
7. Test how antecedent soil moisture works
